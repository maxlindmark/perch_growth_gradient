## Read data

```{r read data}
d <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxlindmark/perch_growth_gradient/master/data/for_analysis/dat.csv") %>% dplyr::select(-...1)

d
glimpse(d)

# Use only length-at-age by filtering on age_ring
# Since there is growth after the age ring was formed (+ growth), 
# we filter to get lengths that correspond to age rings only
d <- d %>% filter(age_ring == "Y")

# age_bc is back-calculated age
# age_catch is age at catch
```
